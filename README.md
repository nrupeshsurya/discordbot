This application is built using YTMusicAPI, SpotifAPI and Discord API.

This allows for asynchronous conversion of Spotify links to Youtube links in the discord platform!

To run this you need a spotify developer account and retrieve the client_id, client_secret and redirect uri. Other than that you will also require your spotify username
link for spotify developers account sign in : https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login
link for figuring out spotify username : https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login
For the discord side of things you will need to create an application in : https://discord.com/developers/applications 
From here you will need to setup and get a token which should be used in the script.
